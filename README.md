# PasswordStrengthChecker

# I developed a program that evaluates the strength of a password based on the following criteria:
# 1.Length of the password
# 2.Presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters
# The program uses Swing to display the result in a user-friendly interface, offering feedback on whether the password is Weak, Medium, or Strong.
